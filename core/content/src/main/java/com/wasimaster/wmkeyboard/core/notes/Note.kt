/**
 * One note in the Notes tool (#560).
 *
 * [body] is the note: plain text that the reading view draws as Markdown, with
 * `- [ ]` lines as boxes to tick. [title] is stored only when the user typed
 * one; most notes written from a keyboard have none, and [displayTitle] reads
 * the first line instead. Storing the derived title would go stale on the
 * first edit of the body, so it is never stored.
 *
 * The flags are deliberately independent: a pinned note can be archived, and
 * a trashed note keeps its pin so [NoteStore.restore] puts it back exactly as
 * it was. [deletedAt] is the trash: set when a note is deleted, cleared when it
 * is restored, and the reason there is no separate undo list anywhere.
 *
 * [createdAt] and [updatedAt] are always written, defaults or not, because
 * the sync merge keys items by `id@createdAt`. The optional fields are written
 * only when set, so a plain note stays a few short lines of JSON.
