/**
 * Word → emoji prediction for the suggestion strip: typing "birthday"
 * offers 🎂🎉🥳🎁, "coffee" offers ☕, "bangladesh" offers 🇧🇩.
 *
 * Four layers, high precision on purpose (this rides along with word
 * suggestions, so a wrong emoji is worse than no emoji):
 *  1. a small curated trigger map, which is where the ordering judgements and
 *     the Bengali triggers live — gemoji has neither;
 *  2. [EmojiTriggers], GitHub's own word→emoji data, which covers far more
 *     English than a hand-written table can ("hooray", "espresso", "workout");
 *  3. an exact [EmojiShortcodes] hit, so the name someone would type between
 *     colons works as plain text too — mostly the two-word codes ("alarm
 *     clock", "crossed fingers"), which nothing else here can reach;
 *  4. exact keyword hits from the catalog (with a trailing plural 's'
 *     stripped) — no prefix or fuzzy matching.
 *
 * The layers stack rather than replace: gemoji has nothing for "sorry",
 * "work" or "sleep", and the curated map has nothing for the other thousand
 * words gemoji names.
